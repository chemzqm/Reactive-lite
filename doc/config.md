## Reuse config

  Reuse config is used for high level component (like list, grid) to make the rendering process extremely fast.

### Generate config

  Reusable config could be generated by `Reactive.generateConfig()`, it's a static method which have the same arguments as
  reactive constructor, the difference is it would not make any change on dom or anything else, instead, it return an array
  of config object.

  The config object have two properties, one is indexes for a node which have reactive binding(s), the other property contains
  a list of binding functions.

### Use config

  Config object is set by option object, like:

  ``` js
  new Reactive(el, model, {delegate: delegate, config: config})
  ```

  Reactive would find each element with binding by something like:

  ``` js
  this.el.childNodes[0].childNodes[1].childNodes[2]
  ```

  And apply the bindings (just functions) by `binding.active(el)` method, everything just works, no element parse and function
  generate any more.

  There are lots of [test](https://github.com/chemzqm/reactive-lite/blob/master/test/config.js) added to make sure binding function is reusable

### List and Grid

  The component [list](https://github.com/chemzqm/list) and [exgrid](https://github.com/chemzqm/exgrid) is working in progress to
  make use of reactive-lite.
